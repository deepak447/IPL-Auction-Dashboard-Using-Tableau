## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries to address various requirements related to IPL match and delivery data. Additionally, it includes a Tableau dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as total runs season-wise, total wickets season-wise, IPL wicket winners, highest run scorers, and highest wicket takers.

## Objectives

The queries and dashboard aim to provide insights into:

- Total runs scored in each IPL season
- Total wickets taken in each IPL season
- IPL teams with the most wicket wins
- Players with the highest number of runs scored
- Players with the highest number of wickets taken

## Instructions

To run the queries and generate the dashboard, you can follow these steps:

1. Install PostgreSQL and Tableau Desktop.
2. Import the `match_data.csv` and `ball_data.csv` files into a PostgreSQL database.
3. Create the queries as shown above and execute them in the database.
4. Connect Tableau Desktop to the database and create the dashboard based on the query results.

The dashboard can be used to analyze the performance of teams and players in the IPL over the years.
